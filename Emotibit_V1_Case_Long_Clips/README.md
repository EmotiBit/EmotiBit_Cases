# EmotiBit Case V1
Designed by the Paquette Lab at the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (UQAC)
Cases can be printed using a 3D printer or sent to a 3D printing service such as https://www.shapeways.com/

## Please Note
V1 cases will work ONLY when using with a non-stacking Adafruit Feather (e.g. https://www.adafruit.com/product/2598), such as those shipped with EmotiBit Beta Units.

With a stacking-header Adafruit Feather (e.g. https://www.adafruit.com/product/3044) that is shipping with Kickstarter orders and preorders on http://shop.emotibit.com/ a slightly taller case design must be utilized.
